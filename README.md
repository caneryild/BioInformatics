-ProteinSequenceWeighedSimilarity.py for comparing two proteins considering two same amino acids in longest common sequence are the same and the different ones have similarity properties, such as 
 	
 	-Hydrophilic,Hydrophobic or positive, negative charge or polarity .... properties of different amino acids can cause similar behavior for the compared region of protein domains.
 	
-longestCommonSubsequence.py for common method to find out largest subsequence
for instance "AB1C23" and "A1BC23" returns --> either ABC23 or A1C23
